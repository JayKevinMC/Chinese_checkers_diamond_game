This code is an implementation of a simple board game known as chinese checkers.

Game description:
1. Blue will go first. Select any piece by left clicking on it. This will highlight the piece with a yellow dot.
2. When left clicked, the available moves will be highlighted with grey dots. Click near the grey dots to move. Right click to end turn.
3. The pawns (light colored small pieces) can never move backwards. The king (bigger pieces) can move in any direction. 
4. Pieces can "jump over" other pieces. If it jumps over the opponent, it will "capture" the piece. Consecutive jumps are possible.
5. When the king is captured or all the pawns are captured, the player will lose the game. 

This is a python based code. It needs the pygames moduel installed to run it. Other than that, I think it will run on most IDEs (currently only tested for vscode).
